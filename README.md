# Midset App
[!screenshot](screenshot.png)
This is an unfinished app to keep track of coordinates on a football field for members of marching bands or drum corps. It uses apache cordova, `vue.js`, `materialize.css`, and I believe `jquery`. Theoretically it's multiplatform. You can try it [!in the browser](https://people.ucsc.edu/~spjpeter/midset) if that's still up.
### Features
 - Unlimited sets
 - Midsets
 - Crossing counts
 - Looks better than most midset apps
### Non features
 - Nothing is saved
 - Every set is 8 counts
 - Can't rearrange sets
 - Meta text is not editable
 - etc
### Why I won't finish this
 1. The project has outgrown `vue.js` and `materialize.css` and really should've started with ionic or something else.
 2. Phone based dotbook solutions suck in general. Phones are unreliable and calculators are a crutch, and the biggest problem is data entry. (OCR may solve this but I'm moving on.)
